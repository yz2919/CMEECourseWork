## Content

### DataWrang.R
Uses `reshape2` for wrangling dataset.

### DataWrangTidy.R
Uses `dplyr` and `tidyr` instead of `reshape2` for wrangling dataset.

### GPDD_Data.R
Map locations from data on a world map

### Girko.R
Plotting Girko's law simulation.

### MyBars.R
Annotates a plot.

### PP_Lattice.R
Produces figures and calculate the mean and median predator mass, prey mass and predator-prey size-ratios from given data.

### PP_Regress.R
Saves pdf with required figure and results.

### Ricker.R
A simulation of the Ricker model.

### TreeHeight.R
Calculates tree heights given distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top, using data from `tree.csv` to create output file `TreeHts.csv`.

### TAutoCorr.R
Tests the correlation between temperatures of one year with the next year (successive years) across years in a given location.

### Vectorize1.R
Sums all elements of a matrix, compare operation time of code with loop and with inbuilt function. 

### Vectorize1.py
A python script of `Vectorize1.R`.

### Vectorize2.R
Vectorize the function of stochastic Ricker Eqn.

### Vectorize2.py
A python script of `Vectorize2.R`.

### apply1.R
Uses `apply` to calculate the mean or variance of rows or columns of a matrix.

### apply2.R
Uses `apply` to define a function `SomeOperation`.

### autocorrelation.Rnw and autocorrelation.tex
Uses Sweave to produce pdf.

### basic_io.R
Illustrates R input-output.

### boilerplate.R
Illustrates how R function accepts "arguments" and "return" values.

### break.R
An example using `break` to stop the loop execution.

### browse.R
An example using `browser()`to insert a breakpoint in a script.

### control_flow.R
Examples of code exemplifying control flow tools in R.

### get_TreeHeight.R
Takes a `.csv` file name from the command line and calculate tree height.

### next.R
Prints odd number in 1~10 using the "modulo" operation.

### plotLin.R
Example of mathematical annotation on a axis in the plot area.

### preallocate.R
Compares function speed with & without preallocation.

### run_get_TreeHeight.sh
Tests `get_TreeHeight.R`, includes `trees.csv` as example file.

### sample.R
Sampling a size from a population and using `sapply` and `lapply` to illustrate vectorization.

### try.R
Blocks of code illustrating `try`.

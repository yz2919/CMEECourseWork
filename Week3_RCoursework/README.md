Week3 RCoursework

basic_io.R
A simple script illustrating R input-output.

control_flow.R
A script includes several control flow tools in R.

break.R
Using break to stop the loop execution.

boilerplate.R
Illustrates how R function accepts "arguments" and "return values.

TreeHeight.R
A function calculates tree heights given distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top.

TreeHeightm.R
A script using TreeHeight function to create a csv output file containing the calculated tree heights along with the original data.

next.R
Checks if a number in 1~10 is odd using the "modulo" operation and prints it if it is.

Vectorize1.R
A script sums all elements of a matrix and sees how much time the code takes ran by loop and by inbuilt function.

apply1.R
Using function apply to calculate the mean or variance of rows or columns of a matrix.

apply2.R
Using function apply to with a function named SomeOperation.

sample.R
Sampling a size from a population and using sapply and lapply to illustrate vectorization.

Ricker.R
A simulation of the Ricker model.

Vectorize2.R
A function vectorizes the stochastic Ricker Eqn.

TAutoCorr.R
A script testing the correlation between temperatures of one year with the next year (successive years) across years in a given location.

autocorrelation.Rnw and autocorrelation.tex
Use Sweave to produce pdf.


DataWrang.R
Using reshape2 for wrangling dataset.

DataWrangTidy.R
Using dplyr and tidyr instead of reshape2 for wrangling dataset.

PP_Lattice.R
A script produces figures and calculate the mean and median predator mass, prey mass and predator-prey size-ratios to a csv file.

Girko.R
Plotting Girko's law simulation.

MyBars.R
Annotating a plot.

plotLin.R
Mathematical annotation on a axis in the plot area.

PP_Regress.R
Saving pdf with required figure and results.
